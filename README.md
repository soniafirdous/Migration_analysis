# 🌍 Net Migration Analysis — World Bank Data

📌 Project Overview

This project explores migration patterns using data gathered from the World Bank. 
The dataset includes key socio-economic indicators such as GDP per capita, unemployment, inflation, population, and health expenditure.

To better compare across countries of different sizes, I also engineered a new feature:

Migration per 1000 people

The focus of this analysis is on India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, examining how economic and demographic factors relate to Net Migration over time.

📂 Dataset Columns

The dataset contains the following columns:

Country 🌍

Year 📅

Net_migration 👥

GDP_per_capita 💰

Unemployment_rate 📉

Inflation 📈

Population_total 👫

Health_expenditure_pctGDP 🏥

Migration_rate_per_1000 (engineered feature)

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📊 Visualizations

Pair Plot → Understand relationships between migration and economic factors.

Line Plot → Trends of Net Migration over time for India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

Bar Plot → Compare migration values across countries in selected years.

Box Plot → Distribution of Net Migration across countries.

Aggregate Plot (Mean) → Average migration statistics by country.

Correlation Heatmap → Identify factors influencing Net Migration (e.g., GDP, unemployment, population).

📈 Key Insights

Net Migration fluctuates significantly across years, often tied to regional economic or political conditions.

Migration per 1000 normalizes migration by population size, making cross-country comparison fairer.

Correlation analysis shows how GDP per capita, unemployment, and population levels are linked to migration inflows and outflows.

Among India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, migration trends highlight differences in economic growth and workforce movement.
